## 🪵 About the Game
Forest Café is a charming cooking & management game set in a small café deep inside a magical forest.
You play as the café owner, preparing drinks and sweets for a variety of woodland animal visitors — each with unique personalities, needs and activity times.

The game blends fast-paced serving gameplay (like Overcooked), cozy life-sim progression, and a day/night cycle that affects customers and available orders.
